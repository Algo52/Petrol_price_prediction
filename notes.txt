-e . we used to import pakeges in Petrol_price pakeges 
were  there are written __init__.py there will try yo install the pakages


what is pakage 
 Exception will going to become pakage and also
  logger,pipeline etc

Now i have created structure in Petrol_price pakage 
component,config,entity,excption,logger,pipeline

Now as like root-level i am going to work on logger and excption

Exception= to handle exceptional error or unexcepted thing
Logger= To get all the logging or Status or what are running in project

"""
--- In logger i wanted all the logs in a separeate floder for that i am creating direactory(dir) and floder name as "logs"  

"""

"""
--- In excption i writing own  exception class
-> (_,_,exec_tb) is  to get line number and file name and "_,_" means value and something which i dont want so thats why i wrote it as underscore _,_,ecxe_tb
-> I used sys module to know which line number cause error or which file name is causing error,excuction info
-> And aslo i used @staticmethod to display the sys module
-> i used staticmethod because i can call function "get_detailed_error_message" whithout calling classname or object of classname

""""
what is object 
It is an  instance of a class
